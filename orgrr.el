;;; Commentary:

;; Orgrr is a minimalist but complete note-taking system for Emacs. Its
;; intended purpose is the creation and management of a Zettelkasten-like
;; system, e.g. many small notes that can easily be linked together.
;;
;;
;;
;;; News
;;
;; 1.1.3
;; - Added configurable config file location.
;;
;; 1.1.2
;; - Redesign of the results buffer; invoking orgrr-search will always start 
;; a new search - even in a search buffer
;;
;; 1.1.1.
;; - Added experimental support for Windows.
;;
;; 1.1.
;; - New function `orgrr-super-compile-sequence' combines `orgrr-compile-squence'
;; and `orgrr-show-backlinks'
;;
;; 1.0.7
;; - Improved pre-selection for `orgrr-compile-sequence'
;;
;; 1.0.6
;; - Improved handling of `orgrr-prepare-findings-buffer' read-only mode; minor changes
;; in keybindings in results buffer; improved handling of existing headings of notes in
;; backlinks buffer
;;
;; 1.0.5
;; - New function `orgrr-find-missing-titles' will find orgmode files without a
;; proper title
;;
;; 1.0.4
;; - Updated readme; More improvements for results buffers: read-only mode, hit n/p for
;; next/previous link; </> for first/last link; enter/return to open the
;; link at point
;;
;; 1.0.3
;; - Better handling of existing headings of notes by
;; `orgrr-compile-sequence' (=increasing them by one level)
;;
;; 1.0.2
;; - Improved handling of `orgrr-update-cache'
;;
;; 1.0.1
;; - Fixes some issues with special characters in filenames
;;
;; 1.0
;; - Caching is now a thing in orgrr; massive speed gains
;;
;; 0.9.19
;; - Improved spacing for lists in `orgrr-show-sequence' and
;; `orgrr-show-multiverse'
;;
;; 0.9.18
;; - Added `orgrr-add-to-other-window'
;;
;;
;; For more changes see the changelog.
